XTW100 is a SPI NOR flash programmer made in China. I create this project
to make using free software on this programmer possible.

You need python-pyusb to run this.

Install the 99-xtw100.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d so that you don't need
root to manipulate the programmer.

Run ipython and `%load xtw100.py` to test this script.
